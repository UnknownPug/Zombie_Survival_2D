#### **Gameplay:**

‚óè The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic future. COVID-19 reached its development and began to turn people into zombies. Our task is to survive in this difficult world. The game is an RPG genre with survival elements. By killing zombies, we will receive useful resources for us (money that can be exchanged for weapons, as well as medicine that will allow us to replenish our units of health).

#### **The end of the game:**

‚óè The game ends after the player dies. Therefore, the very task of the player is not to allow this to happen!

#### **Survival Conditions:** 

‚óè After killing zombies, the player will receive money, which he can spend to buy health points, weapons, food and water.
The player needs to restore health points, food and water in order to survive.
